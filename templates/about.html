      <h1 class="certify-form-title">About CertifyCDNO</h1>
      <h2 class="certify-form-subtitle">Welcome to CertifyCDNO, a cutting-edge blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize how certificates are issued and verified. Our mission is to bring security, transparency, and trust to the certification process, ensuring that credentials remain tamper-proof and accessible to all.</h2>
      <h1 class="certify-form-title">Our Vision</h1>
      <h2 class="certify-form-subtitle">CertifyCDNO aims to leverage blockchain technology to create a future where certification is decentralized, transparent, and reliable. By eliminating intermediaries and securing data on-chain, we empower issuers, recipients, and verifiers to interact seamlessly in a trustless environment. Our platform is a step forward in ensuring that every certification is authentic and easily verifiable.</h2>
      <h1 class="certify-form-title">How We Started</h1>
      <h2 class="certify-form-subtitle">The CertifyCDNO journey began with a simple yet ambitious idea: to address the challenges of fraud and inefficiency in traditional certification systems. With blockchain’s immutability and transparency as our foundation, we embarked on building a prototype to demonstrate the core functionalities of certificate issuance and verification. This prototype allowed us to explore how certificates could be securely stored on the blockchain and verified without revealing sensitive data.</h2>
      <h1 class="certify-form-title">The Prototype</h1>
      <h2 class="certify-form-subtitle">Our prototype focuses on the basics: issuing certificates by securely hashing details, storing them on the blockchain, and enabling anyone to verify them using just the hash. Wallet integration with Nami Wallet ensures a seamless experience for users, while the issuance process is designed to prevent system abuse through a small ADA fee. The prototype has been instrumental in testing our ideas, gathering feedback, and refining the user experience.</h2>
      <h1 class="certify-form-title">What Sets Us Apart?</h1>
      <h2 class="certify-form-subtitle">Blockchain-Powered Security: Certificates are hashed and stored immutably, ensuring authenticity and protecting sensitive data.
Decentralized Governance: A governance framework underpins the system, allowing decisions to be made transparently and collaboratively.
User-Centric Design: We prioritize simplicity and accessibility, making CertifyCDNO intuitive for both technical and non-technical users.</h2>
      <h1 class="certify-form-title">What’s Next?</h1>
      <h2 class="certify-form-subtitle">We’re not stopping here. Based on the prototype’s success and the invaluable feedback from testers, we’re working toward developing a robust Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The MVP will introduce enhanced features such as a more intuitive user interface, advanced governance mechanisms, and additional tools to streamline certificate management and verification.</h2>
      <h1 class="certify-form-title">Join Us on This Journey</h1>
      <h2 class="certify-form-subtitle">CertifyCDNO is more than just a platform—it’s a movement to redefine trust and transparency in certification. Whether you’re a certificate issuer, recipient, or verifier, we invite you to join us in building a decentralized future for secure and reliable certifications.</h2>
